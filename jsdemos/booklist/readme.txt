This example has been copied from the Saxon-JS documentation. It is the book list example
(https://www.saxonica.com/saxon-js/documentation/index.html#!samples/booklist).

The original example demonstrates Saxon-JS. This adapted copy demonstrates yaidom in the browser,
as an alternative way of implementing the same functionality.
