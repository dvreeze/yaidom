package eu.cdevreeze.yaidom

/**
 * XLinks, wrapping an [[eu.cdevreeze.yaidom.Elem]]. The XLink support is without any support for XPointer.
 *
 * In Java speak, this package depends on the [[eu.cdevreeze.yaidom]] package, and not the other way around.
 * In Scala speak, this package is in the [[eu.cdevreeze.yaidom]] namespace.
